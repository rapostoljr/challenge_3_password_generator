# Unique Password Generator

## DESCRIPTION
I was motivated to build this project because cybersecurity is a big issue. Having to come up with a unique passwords can sometimes be a hassle and can cause frustration or anxiety. This program would help people who might have that anxiety of making hard passwords, easier for them. Instead of having to constantly think of a password and worrying about if it is "strong" enough, you can just enter the criteria for a hard password and this program can help with creating you a more secured password.
